## Design

This section describes some details on the design.

TripBuddy allows user interactions via a CLI, which is activated by `TripBuddy`.

The main framework consists of four layers: `CommandHandler`, `ExpenseManager`, `InputHandler` and `Ui`.

<img src="diagrams/class/TripBuddyClassDiagram.png" alt="GeneralDesign" width="700">

This layered design results in less conflicts while developing multiple
features, as well as ensuring testability of different modules.

### ExpenseManager

`ExpenseManager` stores all user data, and has direct CRUD access to them. It saves the **budget**, the **total expense** 
of the user so far, and the list of **categories**. 

Return values of methods of `ExpenseManager` are unprocessed, i.e. not parsed
into `String` or other formats for UI output. 

<img src="diagrams/class/ExpenseDiagram.png" alt="Expense Design" width="300">

It manipulates the array of expenses and has methods to do the following tasks:
* Adds an expense 
* Deletes an expense
* Retrieves the maximum expense
* Retrieves the minimum expense
* Retrieves expenses by category or date

#### Expense
This is a class that saves the data of a specific expense made by the user. It holds important information such as
the name, the amount and the date the expenditure was made. The use of the category is optional.

The amount of the expense is calculated in the base currency. You can change the base currency using the command 
`set-base-currency`. 

#### Currency
This is an enumeration class explaining all the available currencies. The base currency is the one whose exchange rate
is one. The default base currency is SGD. 

### CommandHandler

`CommandHandler` is responsible for the following tasks:
- Collecting and manipulating data from `ExpenseManager` 

- Processing the output into `String` messages to be shown on UI

Parameters of `CommandHandler` methods should be parsed by `InputHandler` already. Every method corresponds to a 
command that can be done in the system. 

For example, in the following sequence diagram, we show how `handlerAddExpense` works.

### InputHandler

`InputHandler` is responsible for the following tasks:

- Analyzing user input and converting arguments into `Command` objects

- Invoking `CommandHandler` methods for command execution.

- Handling exceptions caused by user actions.

Inside this logic, we also find other classes. 

<img src="diagrams/class/CommandDiagram.png" alt="Command Classes" width=400>

#### Command
This class keeps the information of a Command, such as, `view-currency` or `add-expense`. 
It has the following attributes: 
- Keyword: this keeps the information of the type of command (eg. `view-currency`)
- OptList: this keeps a list with the possible optional tokens (eg. `add-expense AMOUNT CURRENCY`)
- OptMap: this keeps information about the optional tokens. The keys are the names of the optional values
  (eg. '-c' if we want to input a currency when using 'add-expense') and the values are the actual values inputted
by the user. 

#### Keyword
This is an enumeration that indicates the different types of commands there are available.

#### Option
This indicates the different arguments a command can have.  
Note: if their value is empty ("") they are mandatory arguments. 

#### Parser
The main tasks for this class are to:
* Parse the user's input to a `Command` object
* Check whether an argument is optional or not 

### Ui

The `Ui` class is responsible for displaying messages to the user via the command-line interface (CLI). It handles:
* Printing prompts and responses for user interactions.
* Displaying success and error messages.
* Formatting outputs for clarity and readability.
* Ensuring smooth user experience by maintaining a consistent UI flow.

### Exceptions 
We have defined different exception types to ensure that all errors are properly covered. 

<img src="diagrams/class/ExceptionDiagram.png" alt="Exception Diagram" width=400>

## Implementation
This section describes an explanation on some of the implemented features. 

### Min-expense
Allows users to be informed on the lowest expense made in real-time.

### Max-expense
Allows users to be informed on the highest expense made in real-time

### Multi-currency support 
Allows users to have multi-currency expenses in the app.
#### **Step 1**: Conversion rates storage
We use a simple dictionary that maps currency codes to their conversion rates relative to the base
currency.

* For example:

```json
{
    "SGD": 1.0,
    "EUR": 1.1,
    "JPY": 0.009,
    "GBP": 1.3
}
``` 

We can also see the current currency rates available in our app using the command 
`view-currency`. This will display the above `json`. 

Moreover, we can also change the base currency. In order to do this, we will:
1. Recalculate existing expenses: all previously recorded expenses need to be recalculated to reflect their values in the new base currency. 
2. Update the budget: update the value of the budget so that is consistent with the current currency.
3. Recalculate Conversion Rates: divide all the values in the conversion dictionary by the current rate to that currency. 

We can see how we do it in the following sequence diagram. 

<img src="diagrams/sequence/SetBaseCurrency.png" alt="Set Base Currency Diagram" width="700">


#### **Step 2**: Conversion logic
When an expense is added:
1. If a different currency is given, a conversion is needed
2. Multiply the expense amount by the conversion rate
3. The value in the base 


#### **Alternatives Considered**
- Keep the original value of the expense as well as the converted value. 

## Product scope

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Performance: The application should process user commands within 1 second.
* Usability: The system should have an intuitive CLI interface with clear error messages and user guidance.
* Reliability: TripBuddy should be able to handle at least 100 expense entries without crashing.
* Portability: The application should be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
* Scalability: The system should allow future enhancements, such as more expense categories, without significant rework.

## Glossary

* *expense* - a record of a purchase made by the user, stored as an `Expense`
entity.
* *budget* – a spending limit set by the user to track expenses and manage finances during a trip.

* *currency* – The unit of money used for recording and viewing expenses. All values are shown in a single reference currency.
* *base currency* – The default currency used to calculate and display all financial information consistently.
* *timestamp* – The date and time when an expense was recorded or changed.

## Instructions for manual testing

Testing Budgeting Features
- Set a budget using the `set-budget` command and verify that the displayed amount is correct.
- Add and delete expenses to ensure that the remaining budget updates accordingly.
- Exceed the budget and check if the system notifies the user about overspending.
- Change the base currency using `set-base-currency` and confirm that the budget and expenses are recalculated properly.

Testing Expense Management
- Add expenses using `add-expense` with and without categories.
- Use `list-expense` to verify that all expenses are listed with accurate amounts.
- Apply `create-category` and assign categories using `set-category`.
- Use `search` to find expenses by partial name match.
- Use `set-time` to modify the timestamp of an existing expense and confirm the updated value is reflected.
- Use `filter-date` with a valid date range to ensure that only expenses within the range are shown.
- Use `max-expense` and `min-expense` to verify the correct expense is identified.

Testing Data Persistence
- Add multiple expenses and categories, then quit the program to trigger auto-saving.
- Restart the program and confirm that all data was correctly loaded from the save file.
- Intentionally corrupt the save file or remove fields and verify that the system handles this gracefully with a message.

Testing Command Handling
- Execute each supported command and confirm it performs as expected.
- Provide invalid commands, missing arguments, or incorrect formats and ensure the system responds with clear error messages.
- Include extra inputs (e.g., `quit now`) and confirm the app ignores them gracefully.

Verifying CLI Feedback
- Confirm that user actions result in clear and informative messages (e.g., budget set, expense added).
- Test the welcome and exit messages on application start and quit.
- Check that currency formatting, dates, and categories are consistently displayed.

Checking Error and Exception Handling
- Try adding an expense with a missing name or duplicate name.
- Provide a negative or very large number for budget or amount.
- Assign a category to a non-existent expense.
- Use an incorrect timestamp format in `set-time` or `filter-date`.
- Force a save/load operation on invalid data and ensure the program remains stable.

Edge Case and Robustness Testing
- Add extremely long or empty strings for names and categories.
- Use mixed-case, numeric, or symbolic inputs.
- Run commands with missing flags, extra spaces, or unexpected inputs to ensure the app handles them cleanly.
